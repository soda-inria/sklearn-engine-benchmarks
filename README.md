# sklearn-engine-benchmarks
Benchopt suite to compare alternative scikit-learn engines for the same estimators.

This project is an effort at a comprehensive and systematic benchmarking of
implementations of various machine learning algorithms, distributed in various libraries
that are considered to be interfaces as engines with the scikit-learn experimental
plugin API.
